# Number Game
Welcome to the Number Game! Here's how it works:

I have selected a mystery number between 1 and 100. Your challenge is to guess that number correctly. After each guess, I'll provide you with hints to guide you closer to the mystery number. If your guess is too high or too low, I'll let you know.

If you manage to guess the mystery number correctly, you'll hear a triumphant "Ding ding ding!" Otherwise, tough luck! But don't worry, you can always take another shot.

Are you ready to play? Let's get started! Just type in your guess, and we'll see if you can crack the code!
